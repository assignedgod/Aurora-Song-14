**Welcome to the Denu!**
With the Denu, you can accentuate certain words in your messages and have messages that contain both dialogue and actions within!

**Getting Started:**
First, click the 'Enable Auto-Formatter' toggle. Without it, these chat features will not function, including both color and text formatting.

**Basic Formatting:**
• \"Dialogue in quotes\" uses your chosen dialogue color
• \*Actions in asterisks\* uses your chosen emote color

**Text Styles in Dialogue:**
Just like Discord, you can style words within quotes:
• \*word\* = *italic*
• \*\*word\*\* = **bold**
• \*\*\*word\*\*\* = ***bold italic***

**Example:**
\"Hey do \*not\* touch that door!\" \*backs away\*
Player A says: "Hey do *not* touch that door!" *backs away*

**Color Customization:**
Use the RGB sliders to color your dialogue and emotes separately. The Message Example shows your color choices in action.

Be aware that whisper, emote and subtle channels automatically italicize everything. You can still use bold, but regular italics will blend in.

**Additional Options:**
• **Remove Asterisks**: Removes \* symbols from emote text
• **Typing Toggle**: Keeps typing indicator on until toggled off or you send a message
• **Live Preview**: Check the Preview tab to see your formatted message as you type

**Note:** Auto-formatting doesn't work in OOC, LOOC, Radio, or Dead channels.
