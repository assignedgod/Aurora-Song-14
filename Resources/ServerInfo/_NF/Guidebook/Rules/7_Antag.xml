# 7. Antagonism

Even bad guys follow their own rules.

    - When taking a ghost role, follow its set of rules unless told otherwise by an admin.
    -- Spamming ahelp asking for an exception will likely lead to a ban.
    -- Solo antags (e.g. space dragon) and free agents should not work with team antagonists (e.g. pirates).
    -- Non-Antagonists may not explicitly seek out an antagonist to assist them, but you are not obligated to turn down any requests of aid from one unless it is an existential threat (such as nukies)
	-- Antagonists might force you to do things, and while this can be interesting roleplay please remember your consent is important!    - Antagonist roles are [bold]expected[/bold] to act hostile towards non-antagonists.
    -- Antagonists include xenomorphs, nuclear operatives, space dragons, zombies and pirates.
    - Free agents [bold]may[/bold] act hostile towards non-antagonists or not, at their discretion.
