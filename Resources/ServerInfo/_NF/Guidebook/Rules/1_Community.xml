# 1. Community Expectations

  - This server is about chaotic fun, collaborative storytelling, and mutual respect. If you're here to have fun at other people's expense, you are in the wrong place.

## 1.1 Do not be a dick

    - Don't make the game worse for others. If what you're doing would piss off a reasonable person, just don't do it.
    - Roleplay is collaborative. Story, friction, and conflict make things interesting, but they're tools to make a good story together. Don't fight other players, fight their characters.
    - Harassment and bigotry aren't welcome. No slurs, no bullying, no "just joking", no pushing boundaries to get a reaction.
    - Antagonists are part of the story too. You create chaos, but your actions should pull others in, not push them out.
    - Err towards not being a problem. If you're not sure about something you want to do, aim away from disrupting others, or ask OOC. If you have to make excuses for your behavior, you probably know you crossed the line - just apologize and move on.
    - We forgive honest mistakes. But not repeated ones. We believe in growth and second chances, but if you consistently make the game less fun or less safe for others, you're not welcome here.
    - Do not push political messages of any kind in chat, images, drawings or faxes.
    - Do not grief as a non-antagonist; this includes against AFK and SSD/catatonic players.

## 1.2 Do not powergame

  - It will be considered as displaying a consistent pattern of antisocial and unsporting behavior in which a player prioritizes their game experience at the expense of others through routine optimization and abuse of game mechanics/knowledge.


## 1.3 Respect consent

  - Part of the server's environment caters to adult themes, and not everyone is here for that. If someone signals via LOOC, or their consent menu, that they are not interested in that kind of content you must respect that and not knowingly subject them to it.
