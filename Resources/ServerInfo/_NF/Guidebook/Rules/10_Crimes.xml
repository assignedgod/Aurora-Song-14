# 10. Crimes and Fines

Server rules must be followed, but Space Law can be broken with some considerations.

    - Capital crimes have big character connotations, and shouldn't be committed lightly.
    - Robbery demands should generally be kept reasonable
    -- As one of few hard rules in the guidelines, you must not hold someone up for the contents of their bank account (unless the scene was prior agreed upon)
    - If a silicon is responsible for a crime, the person giving the order is generally responsible.
    - Punishment can compound depending on the number of counts of a single crime and the severity.
    -- Refer to Space Law for a list of fines, punishments, and limits.
    - You must wait at least 20 minutes to loot, salvage, or claim an abandoned shuttle.
    -- This 20 minutes starts from when you confirm it is abandoned.
