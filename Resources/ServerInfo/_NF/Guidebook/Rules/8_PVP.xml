# 8. Player vs. Player Combat


    - Boarding other players shuttles is allowed.
    -- We recommend that negotiations be attempted before boarding actions are started.
    - We recommend making combat confrontations a give and take, rather than just robusting people
    -- It helps make more interesting narratives when characters can pause in gunfights to shout at one another every now and then!
    - Hostile forces that are known, declared, and confirmed, may be considered 'belligerent'.
    -- Belligerent ships may be boarded non-conventionally, and have their systems disabled in attempts to bring them to justice.
