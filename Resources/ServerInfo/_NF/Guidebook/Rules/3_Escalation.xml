# 3. Escalation Guidelines


    - Antagonistic ghost roles and pest ghost roles like mice are always fair game for attack.
    - As a non-antagonist, don't attack Sector-aligned ghost roles like familiars, drones, or pets without provocation.
    - Do not attack another player without a legitimate, explainable roleplay reason that could be applied in a similar, real-life scenario.
    - An outline of escalation can, but does not have to, look like:
    -- Identify other party and declare aggression
    -- Engage with low level conflict measures(non-lethal/crowd control measures, disablers etc)
    -- Escalate to firearms and lethal weapons
    - If a fight results in someone being critically injured or killed, do not hide the body. Take steps to prevent rot if it does not put you at risk.
    - If a fight ends and both parties leave the area, you cannot skip escalation and plunge back into a fight. What's done is done.
    - Security Forces and command roles must resolve situations with non-lethal force and de-escalate IC confrontation except in cases where there is a reasonable chance of harm/death.
